# TicTacToeBoard
General Description:

The motivation behind this project was to test myself and evaluate the progress that I could make on a personal project using the information that I learned from my coursework. This project allowed me to practice skills in Java progamming and JavaFX. This project helped me to learn more about event handling and the various subclasses of Event that were available. This project also provided the opportunity to learn more about how I could incorporate CSS in creating unique projects and make my project more attractive.

Project Status:

-This project is still in progress. As I learn more about the game's bugs and explore the different changes I could make to the game to make it more interesting, I plan to continue to improve and build on the current state of the project. 

Possible Changes/Additions to the Project:
- Options for different colors for users to play the game with
- Options for different symbols/words for the users to play the game with (i.e. Xs, Os, check signs)
- Make code more concise
